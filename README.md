# AISpacePuzzle

This is a fan-made tool designed to generate combinations. It does not include colorblind-friendly options.

Note: Generating different combinations should be as simple as pressing a button. I aim to keep the tool straightforward and won't be adding additional features.

## To Be Continued 
1. ~~Waiting for my board game to arrive in order to accurately generate the 20 combinations, rather than relying on random generation.~~ Done
2. Need assistance with creating colorblind-friendly backgrounds and/or shapes to enhance user experience.
3. ~~Create an APK for download via GitHub.~~ Done
